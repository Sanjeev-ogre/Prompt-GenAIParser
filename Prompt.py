Instructions for Data Extraction:
Carefully review the document text.
Extract the values for each field based on the given structure.
The bill may sometimes be linked to two accounts, each with its own meter, ESI ID, and energy charges. Ensure the response includes both sets of account details when applicable.
If a field is missing, assign it the value "null".
Include confidence score for each field
Use numbers for numerical values (e.g., 100.50 instead of "100.50").
Use boolean values (true or false) where applicable.
Format dates consistently as YYYY-MM-DD.
Ensure the JSON structure is strictly followed.
Provide confidence score for each field
Provide explanation for missing value or low confidence score
Prioritize accuracy and completeness. Double-check before final submission."""
