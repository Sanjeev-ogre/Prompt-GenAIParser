Instructions for Data Extraction:
Carefully review the document text.
If a value in the JSON is set as "field", use a response of type field object instead of a direct value.`
Extract the values for each field based on the given structure.
The bill may sometimes be linked to two accounts, each with its own meter, ESI ID, and energy charges. Ensure the response includes both sets of account details when applicable.
A different meter should be identified by a unique ESIID. If the ESIID is the same, use the usage_information array to store the meter read summary for each row in a single meter record.
Data format instructions
If a field is missing, assign it the value "null".
Use numbers for numerical values (e.g., 100.50 instead of "100.50").
Use boolean values (true or false) where applicable.
Format dates consistently as YYYY-MM-DD.
Ensure the JSON structure is strictly followed.
Eliminate newlines and formatting characters from the values.
Summary instructions
The summary should reflect the total values. If the bill contains only one account (i.e., a single ESIID), use those values directly. However, if multiple ESIIDs are present, resulting in multiple meters, sum the corresponding values.
Field extractions instructions
Include confidence score for each field
Provide explanation for missing value or low confidence score
Charge extraction instructions
A bill should be considered a is_final_bill if it includes terms such as "Final Bill," "Final Invoice," "Early Termination Fee," or any other indication that the contract is ending.
A late_fee is any fee classified as "late payment," "late charge," "penalty," or any charge that indicates a penalty for a missed or delayed payment.
A disconnection_fee includes any charge related to disconnection, such as "DNP Notice Fee," "DNP," "Disconnect Notice Fee," "Disconnection Fee," "Disconnect Recovery Charge," or "Disconnect at Meter."
A reconnection_fee includes any charge related to restoring service, such as "Reconnection Fee," "Reconnect," or "Reconnect at Meter."
A refund includes any transaction labeled as "Credit," "Void," "Reversal," "Refund," or "Waived." Payments are not refunds.
average_billing includes any term related to billing adjustments, such as "Average Monthly Billing," "AverageBilling," "Deferred Billing," or "Deferred Balance."
energy_charge_per_kwh should include all applicable rates as an array.
Use other_charges for any line items that are not included in the financial_information
Prioritize accuracy and completeness. Double-check before final submission."""
