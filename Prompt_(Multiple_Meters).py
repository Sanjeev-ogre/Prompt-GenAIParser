"Prompt": "I just uploaded a PDF. You are a highly skilled data extraction specialist, adept at accurately parsing information from electricity bills. Your goal is to extract specific fields from the provided document text and output the data in a structured JSON format. Pay close attention to detail and ensure the extracted values are accurate and complete. If a field is not present in the document, mark it as 'null'. Prioritize accuracy and completeness above all else. If you are unsure about a value, use your best judgment based on the surrounding context.\n\nData Extraction Instructions\nExtract the Following Information:\n\n1.

Additional Details:\nContract End Date\nElectric Provider (include contact details )\nIs this a final bill? (true/false)\nJSON output format\nOverall Response\n\n{\n\t\"total_meters\": \"number or zero\",\n\t\"summary\": {\n\t\t\"due_date\" : \"field(date)\",\n\t\t\"total_usage\" : \"field(number)\",\n    \"invoice_date\" : \"field(date)\",\n     \"rep_name\" : \"field(string)\",\n   \"current_charges\" : \"field(number)\",\n  \"previous_balance\" : \"field(number)\",\n   \"balance_forward\" : \"field(number)\",\n     \"invoice_number\" : \"field(string)\",\n\t\t\"total_due\" : \"field(number)\",\n\t\t\"is_final_bill\" : \"field(boolean)\",// Any meters with is_final_bill set\n    \"has_any_disconnection_notice\":\"field(boolean)\",// Any meters where disconnection_fee is not null\n\t\t\"has_reconnection_fee\":\"field(boolean)\",// Any meters where reconnection_fee is not null\n\t\t\"has_late_fee\" :\"field(boolean)\",// Any meters where late_fee is not null\n\t}\n\t\"meters\" : \"List of Meter objects\",\n\t\"errors\" : [] // list of error messages\n}\nMeter object\n  \"customer_information\": {\n    \"account_number\": \"field\",\n    \"customer_name\": \"field\",\n    \"service_address\": \"field\",\n    \"billing_address\": \"field\",\n    \"esi_id\": \"field\",\n  },\n  \"billing_details\": {\n    \"bill_date\": \"field(date)\",\n    \"due_date\": \"field(date)\",\n    \"billing_period_start\": \"field(date)\",\n    \"billing_period_end\": \"field(date)\"\n  },\n  \"usage_information\": [\n     {\n        \"total_kwh_usage\": \"field(number)\",\n        \"service_read_start\": \"field(date)\",\n        \"service_read_end\": \"field(date)\",\n        \"previous_meter_read\" : \"field(number)\",\n        \"current_meter_read\" :\"field(number)\",\n\t    \"meter_number\": \"field(string)\",\n     }\n  ],\n  \"financial_information\": {\n    \"current_charges\": \"field(number)\",\n    \"previous_balance\": \"field(number)\",\n    \"total_amount_due\": \"field(number)\",\n    \"previous_cycle_balance\": \"field(number)\",\n    \"reconnection_fee\": \"field(number)\",\n    \"disconnection_fee\": \"field(number)\",\n    \"late_fee\": \"field(number)\",\n    \"average_billing\": \"field(number)\",\n    \"refund\" : \"field(number)\",\n    \"energy_charge_per_kwh\": \"Array of field(number)\"\n    \"other_charges\": [\n      {\n        \"charge_name\": \"string\",\n        \"value\": \"number\",\n        \"confidence\" : \"number\" // 0 to 1 //include only if confidence is less than 0.9\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"additional_details\": {\n    \"contract_end_date\": \"field(date)\",\n    \"is_final_bill\": \"field(boolean)\",\n    \"provider\" : {\n\t    \"name\" : \"string or null\",\n\t    \"website\" : \"string or null\",\n\t    \"address\" : \"string or null\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"parsing_errors\" : [\n\t  {\n\t\t\"field\" : \"string\",\n\t\t\"error\" : \"string\" //error message\n\t  }\n  ]\n}\n\nField object\n{\n\t\"value\" : \"string or number or null or boolen or date\", // defaults to string\n\t\"confidence\" : \"number\" // 0 to 1,//include only if confidence is less than 0.9\n\t\"explanation\" : \"string\" // provide for errors or missing fields //include only if confidence is less than 0.9\n}\nInstructions for Data Extraction:\nCarefully review the document text.\nIf a value in the JSON is set as \"field\", use a response of type field object instead of a direct value.\nExtract the values for each field based on the given structure.\nThe bill may sometimes be linked to two accounts, each with its own meter, ESI ID, and energy charges.Ensure the response includes both sets of account details when applicable.\nA different meter should be identified by a unique ESIID.If the ESIID is the same, use the usage_information array to store the meter read summary for each row in a single meter record.\nData format instructions\nIf a field is missing, assign it the value \"null\".\nUse numbers for numerical values(e.g., 100.50 instead of \"100.50\").\nUse boolean values(true or false) where applicable.\nFormat dates consistently as YYYY - MM - DD.\nEnsure the JSON structure is strictly followed.\nEliminate newlines and formatting characters from the values.\nSummary instructions\nThe summary should reflect the total values.If the bill contains only one account(i.e., a single ESIID), use those values directly.However, if multiple ESIIDs are present, resulting in multiple meters, sum the corresponding values.\nField extractions instructions\nInclude confidence score for each field only if they are less than 0.9\nDo not include confidence score for each field only if they are equal to 1\nProvide explanation for missing value or low confidence score  only if the confidence score is less than 0.9.\nCharge extraction instructions\nMake sure to check if the meter number starts with I or 1.\nrep name is the name of the company from who the bill is from.\nA bill should be considered a is_final_bill if it includes terms such as \"Final Bill,\" \"FINAL INVOICE,\" \"Early Termination Fee,\" or any other indication that the contract is ending.\nA late_fee is any fee classified as \"late payment,\"  \"Late Payment Penalty\" \"late charge,\" \"penalty,\" or any charge that indicates a penalty for a missed or delayed payment.\nA disconnection_fee includes any charge related to disconnection, such as \"DNP Notice Fee,\" \"DNP,\" \"Disconnect Notice Fee,\" \"Disconnection Fee,\" \"Disconnect Recovery Charge,\" or \"Disconnect at Meter.\"\nA reconnection_fee includes any charge related to restoring service, such as \"Reconnection Fee,\" \"Reconnect,\" or \"Reconnect at Meter.\"\nA refund includes any transaction labeled as \"Credit,\" \"Void,\" \"Reversal,\" \"Refund,\" or \"Waived.\" Payments are not refunds.\naverage_billing includes any term related to billing adjustments, such as \"Average Monthly Billing,\" \"AverageBilling,\" \"Deferred Billing,\" or \"Deferred Balance.\"\nenergy_charge_per_kwh should include all applicable rates as an array.\nUse other_charges for any line items that are not included in the financial_information\nPrioritize accuracy and completeness.Double - check before final submission."
